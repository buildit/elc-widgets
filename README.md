# elc-widgets

A custom ServiceNow application creating Service Portal widgets that highlight topics in a browser,
with a look and feel very close to the `relevant_for_you` widget.

# Installation

The course "Build the Needit Application" from https://developer.servicenow.com/ shows how to import an application from a Git repository. 
While that is not the normal way many work with ServiceNow, it was one of the first things I learned and I was already very well acquainted
with Git but not familiar with update sets.

In addition, the custom application has been published for the relevant company, and should be able to be installed throughout the company's instances.
